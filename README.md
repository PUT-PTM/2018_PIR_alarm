# PIR_Alarm

# Overview 
A simple alarm that should scare a burglar.

# Description 
The project is supported by means of the Pin Pad connected to the stm32 PCB. All necessary information is displayed in Polish. The alarm 
detects the burglar via the PIR motion sensor.

# Tools  
STM32F4 Discovery board
LCD display 2x16 characters with Driver compatible with HD44780
RGB diode
12 Button 3x4 Keypad
PIR Motion Detector
Buzzer
potentiometer

# How to run 
Fetch our project, and run it using System Workbench for STM32. Upload program to STM32F4 Discovery and connect all needed pins. Then follow the steps listed on the display.

PinPad
Pin 1 = column 2 = PE12
Pin 2 = row 1 = PE7
Pin 3 = column 1 = PE11
Pin 4 = row 4 = PE10 - fioletowy
Pin 5 = column 3 = PE13
Pin 6 = row 3 = PE9
Pin 7 = row 2 = PE8
